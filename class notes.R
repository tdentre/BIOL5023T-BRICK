##### Class Notes
##### Using different plots can lead to different interpretations so it is important to try plotting multiple different ways.
##### Coefficient is a discription of how 1 variable relates to another.
##### Interaction is between predictor variables; so one variable depends on the other (sex and location are variables, mass is reponse)
##### p-value is the probability of getting a response (coefficient) just by chance
##### t-value is relationship between coefficient and standard error
##### Redo assignment, look at Phil's example
##### t-value larger with sample size, as error declines t-value increases, as strength of relationship gets stronger (coefficient) t-value also gets larger
##### extract all data and put in the dataframe to begin.
##### "evidense for an effect"

##### if you have two levels you are estimating a single parameter, if you have level A and B, you only have to know if it is A, because if it is not, you know it is B
##### use residuals vs. fitted plat to assess model fit
